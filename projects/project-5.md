summary: Using deep learning algorithms to detect deforestation in satellite imagery
---


Deforestation is one of the major contributing factor to climate change. Vegetation loss has led to changing climatic conditions that have been witnessed all over the world. In Brazil, its estimated that over 500,000 square kilometres of natural vegetation have been cut down in the last 50 years. Serious interventions are needed to curb this trend. Satellite imagery analysis is one of the ways we can detect and monitor deforestation. In this project, I have analysed Sentinel-2 imagery of three regions in the State of MatoGrosso in Brazil and derived image chips to train a deep learning model to detect deforestation. 
The results show that these are algorithms are capable of identifying small changes in vegetation cover and can therefore be applied in monitoring our forests.
