summary: Time series climate data analysis in R 
---


Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment published observed and projected data on climate with a high temporal coverage of observed and projected data. The data consists of various weather and climate elements including temperature, precipitation, humidity, air pressure, etc. In this work, I will be analysing the various datasets () using R programming. The data is available at https://worldclim.org/ and https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip5/ (CMIP5 models).
I will be analysing observed and projected data for the following:
- Temperature
- Precipitation
