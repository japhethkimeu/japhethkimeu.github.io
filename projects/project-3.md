Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) developed by Renard et al. (1996) is one of the methods popularly used in estimating soil loss. In this project, I implemented RUSLE in GEE to estimate soil loss in North-Western Somalia. RUSLE id described by A = R * K * LS * C * P where A is the mean annual soil loss in metric tonnes/ha/year, R is rainfall erosivity, K is soil erodibility factor, LS is slope length-steepness factor, C is cover and management factor and P is erosion managemnet factor.
