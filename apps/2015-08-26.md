This Google Earth Engine application lets a user draw a region of interest as a polygon and computes the soil loss of the region per year. It is based on RUSLE method of estimating soil loss developed by Wischmeier and Smith in 1965. The model uses several factors to estimate soil loss in any area and provides guideline for the development of conservation plans and controlling erosion under different land-cover conditions. The factors include Rainfall erosivity, Soil erodibility, Slope - Length steepness, Cover and Management, and Erosion management factors.
